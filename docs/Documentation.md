# EZDSP Documentation

## What is EZDSP?

EZDSP is an audio plug-in that allows users to edit the plug-in's DSP source code from directly within their favorite DAW.  

## How does it work?


The EZDSP interface consists of two main elements: The DSP Code Editor and the Components Window. Understanding how these elements interact is key to getting your first plug-in up and running.

### The DSP Code Editor

This is where you will write your DSP code. This code exists within a loop, meaning that it will be executed iteratively for each incoming sample of audio.

The DSP Code Editor is powered by the SOUL language, and as such all SOUL functions and operators can be accessed from within the "soul::" namespace. More info on the SOUL language syntax can be found here: [SOUL Documentation](https://github.com/soul-lang/SOUL/blob/master/docs/SOUL_Language.md)

While variables can be declared locally from within the DSP Code Editor, it's important to remember that this code is executed iteratively, meaning that any variables declared from the DSP Code Editor will be reset to their initial value for each sample processed. 

### The Components Window:

This is where you will add global variables that can be accessed from within your DSP Code. These variables can be standalone values, or they can be linked to a slider or button. A component's value can be accessed from your DSP Code via the component's given name. The four types of components are:

1) **Slider** - This will output a stream of values, which is constantly updated to reflect the current position of the slider. This is a visual component.
```markdown
  Parameters:  
  Min: The slider's minimum value  
  Max: The sliders maximum value  
  Init: The slider's initial value  
  Step: The interval between slider values  
  Name: The slider's label and the variable name used to access the slider's current value  
```
2) **Button** - This will output a binary value (0=OFF,1=ON). This is a visual component.
```markdown
  Parameters:  
  Name: The button's label and the variable name used to access the button's current value  
```  
3) **Buffer** - This will store an array of values (most often an array of audio samples). Additionally, each Buffer created comes with a memory safe "indexer" variable that is initialized to zero. This indexer takes the name of the corresponding buffer, with "Index" appended.
```markdown
  Parameters:  
  Name: The variable name used to access a buffer value  
  Type: The value type that the buffer stores (integer or floating point numbers)  
  Size: The number of values to be stored in the buffer  
``` 
4) **Number** - This will store a single numeric value.
```markdown
  Parameters:  
  Init: The variable's initial value  
  Name: The variable name used to access the variable's current value  
  Type: The value type that the variable stores (integer or floating point number)  
```

### Keywords

These variables reflect important information about your current DAW Project

- BPM - The current tempo in beats per minute
- SAMPLERATE - The current sample rate in hertz
- SAMPLESPERBEAT - The number of samples per quarter note, given the current tempo and sample rate
- NUMERATOR - The current time signature numerator (the number of beats per measure)
- DENOMINATOR - The current time signature denominator (the beat value)

## Why EZDSP?

Audio programming is a uniquely tedious and complicated subsect of computer programming. The goal of EZDSP is to strip these details away, providing a clear and intuitive way of learning the basics of digital signal processing. Creating a simple delay plug-in with C++ can require hundreds of lines of code, with EZDSP it can be done with three. We want to make audio programming as accessible as possible, bringing together programmers and musicians to create digital audio effects that can be easily created, used, and shared
